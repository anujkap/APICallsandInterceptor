# APICallsandInterceptor
This project is to showcase the use of ViewModels and network Interceptor for API Calls in Android Apps

To access the interceptor go to chrome://inspect and connect your mobile in usb debugging.
On launching the app it should show up in the inspect window and then you can see the requests and responses from the app.

To setup this in your application, reffer to the code in this repo, and refactor the files in it to suit your code.
Do not forget to make changes in manifest and adding the network interceptor.
